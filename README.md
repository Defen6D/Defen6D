# Howdy! 👋

I'm a Montanan who loves spending time outdoors in nature, programming computer software, building cloud systems, and shredding the trails on my bike.

## About Me

- 🌲 I grew up in the small town of Bozeman, surrounded by the natural beauty of Montana.
- 💻 As a kid, I spent most of my time exploring the outdoors, camping, hiking, and fishing. As I got older, I developed a passion for computers and programming, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science.
- 🏢 After graduating from college, I landed a job as a software developer at a local tech company. I've been working there for the past five years, and I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from building cloud systems to developing mobile apps.

## My Hobbies

- 🚵 When I'm not coding, you can usually find me out on the trail, tearing it up with nothing but a bit of give in the front forks. There's nothing quite like the rush from managing a slide or navigating a technical section of trail.
- 🏕️ I also love spending time in the great outdoors, whether it's camping, hiking, or just taking a leisurely stroll through the woods. The enveloping tranquility of nature is an elixir that revitalizes my soul and helps me rejuvenate my energies
